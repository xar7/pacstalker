PACSTALKER: Pacman

* Introduction
* Use of the network
** TLS session
   Pacman seems to use one tls session for each package he installs.
   That way it is quite easy to delimitate a package transfer with tools such as wireshark.
** How to get the package size ?
   We just have to sum all packet size and substract the size of the header!
   Then it should be possible to have an approximate size of the whole package in order to compare it with the mirror database.
