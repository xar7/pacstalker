* apt
  APT does not use https and they are quite explicit about it.
  see website : whydoesaptnotusehttps.com !
  Actually what they say is pretty accurate ...
  What is the purpose of https as anyone could guess what packages you're installing by analyzing time or size ?
* dnf
  dfn does use some ssl/tls sessions to transfer the application data.
  What is quite impressive is that dnf does not use https for the get request it sends.
  So one can actually just read the get request to see what package is being installed/updated.
* Pacman
  Almost all pacman connections are made throught ssl/tls.
** TLS session
   Pacman seems to use one tls session for each package he installs.
   That way it is quite easy to delimitate a package transfer with tools such as wireshark.
** How to get the package size ?
   We just have to sum all packet size and substract the size of the header!
   Then it should be possible to have an approximate size of the whole package in order to compare it with the mirror database.


* Missing sizes
- acl: 580 en + pour 102 paquets
- automake: 1013 en + pour 452 paquets
- binutils: 27692 en + pour 3701 paquets
- less: 35054 en + pour 103 paquets&
