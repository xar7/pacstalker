* Tools
** Wireshark
   A network protocol analyzer with great GUI.
   I know how to basically use it and to filter tls session.
*** Learn how to use filters more effectively
** tcpdump
** Scapy
   A python API to do network stuff.
* Package manager
** TODO Pacman
** TODO APT (Debian)
* TODO Script
  The idea is to be able to get a script that will take as input a network capture and compute the size of the installed packages.
  Then the script would compare it to all packets size in the mirrors to deduce which packages were installed or updated.
